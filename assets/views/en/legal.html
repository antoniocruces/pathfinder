					<li>Third-party cookies stored in a domain other than the domain of the visited page. This may occur when the web page refers to a file, such as JavaScript, that is outside your domain.</li>
					</ul>
					
					<h4 id="title-legal19">What type of cookies does PATHFINDER use?</h4>
					
					<ul>

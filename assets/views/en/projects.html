<p class="dropcap">Exhibitium generates awareness about temporary art exhibitions for their multi-faceted use and reuse. This was the slogan of the proposal presented in the 2014 seminar held by the BBVA foundation for projects in the field of Digital Humanities, resulting in the project being chosen from among more than 250 applicants.</p>
<p>The evaluation committee particularly took into account its potential as a ‘project of important social impact to promote knowledge in the field of art history in circuits less accessible by conventional methods. Exhibitium is very innovative, with great technological competence dedicated to the art world and the impact that it has on society”.</p>
<p>Exhibitium focuses attention on the phenomenon of art exhibitions that are regularly held by galleries, museums and art centers, foreseeing them in their status as complex cultural phenomena resulting in the establishment of a series of relationships between certain actors, but also in strategic factors in the promotion of social dynamics and economic movements.</p>
<p>For this, Exhibitium proposes the development of a technological tool that serves as a base to produce a platform destined for the development and analysis of data available with regards to these exhibitions. Our proposal is based on the conjugation of a series of computer technologies and analysis methodologies derived from technological surveillance, network analysis, and the KDD strategy (Knowledge Discovery in Databases), which allow us to capture, register, structure and process this data in a meaningful way; as well as extract unpublished knowledge based on quantitative and qualitative parameters (networks, clusters, and patterns) to make them useful and reusable, by means of open and interoperable data systems.</p>
<p>We consider that the results of the Exhibitium project will be interesting for a wide range of sectors:</p>
<ul><li>Scientific-academic (preparation of theories and critical interpretations);</li>
<li>Cultural institutions (strategic decisions on the design of exhibition programs);</li>
<li>Tourist and leisure industries (preparation of itineraries and pleasure-cultural activities based on this data);</li></ul>
<p>The public and citizens themselves (socialisation from generated information and appropriation by the public and citizens in order to generate new cultural itineraries or new social dynamics surrounding temporary exhibitions).</p>
<p>The project forms part of the lines of work undertaken by iArtHis_Lab, whose specific aim is the promotion, development and consolidation of the Digital Art History studies in Spain, which fall as a specific and differentiated aspect, within the wide field that Digital Humanities currently covers. This project also forms part of the initiatives promoted by the International Network of Digital Studies on the Artistic Culture, ReArte.Dix, the first international organisation dedicated to this purpose in the Spanish speaking context. It is funded by the University of Malaga as part of their own research plan and as part of the projects associated with the Campus of International Excellence Andalusia Tech.</p>
<p>In addition to the iArtHis_Lab research group, the project includes researchers who lead research groups specialising in the analysis of large data sets, such as Khaos, the research group from the University of Malaga, headed by Professor of Computer Science, Jose F. Aldana Montes, and the CulturePlex laboratory at the University of Western Ontario (Canada), directed by Juan Luis Suarez.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The catalogue is one of the textual-narrative structures that has had the greatest impact on the construction and modelling of artistic knowledge, and on the creation of its narratives and discourse (by legitimising or delegitimising them). In fact, the construction of art history is based on a process of categorising cultural products, and on a dynamics involving inclusions and exclusions, the formation of hierarchies and silences, of which the catalogue is a fundamental instrument. We therefore consider that the objectives of this project are: first, to unravel the mechanisms underlying the processes of producing catalogues as generators and mediators of knowledge, materialised in diverse narratives and discourses; and, second, to investigate the model of knowledge involved in it – that is, its gnoseology. This is of vital importance to be able to understand, on the one hand, the reason why we know (and hence study) artistic facts in a particular way and, on the other, how the complex and variable epistemological and discursive framework of Art History has been constructed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Despite this key nature, no systematic study of the catalogue has been undertaken to date. For this reason, we consider that this project fills an important gap in the research dedicated to gaining a better knowledge of the modern construction of Art History.</p>
<p>Within this general framework, <strong>ArtCalog</strong> focuses its attention on the analysis of catalogues related to Spanish art or to Spanish artists, produced either in Spain or abroad, throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. This definition of the field of action allows us to verify the initial assumptions about the catalogue according to a particular conceptual axis and from a transnational perspective.</p>
<p>Another crucial objective of this project is also to contribute to the implementation of new methodologies and the development of new interpretative models. In this regard, the analysis incorporates, on the one hand, the intellectual framework associated with network theory, and more specifically with Bruno Latour&#8217;s Actor-Network Theory, which describes the production of knowledge as the result of relationships formed among heterogeneous actors that establish a range of networks over time. Thus, in addition to its textual-narrative nature, <strong>ArtCatalog</strong> also explores the catalogue as a space for the mediation of these interactions.</p>
<p>Likewise, it also includes a series of analysis strategies linked to computational processing and visualisation of large datasets (network analysis, mapping, clustering, /KDD techniques/, etc.). These strategies allow us to pose unprecedented questions about the production and circulation of knowledge associated with the catalogue by making it possible to perform a multi-scale analysis &#8212; from the macro-local to the micro-local &#8212; and enabling us to investigate the logics (patterns) that define these processes.</p>
<p>Consequently, one of the crucial aims of this project is the construction of a structured data repository <strong>(DataCatalog)</strong> on art catalogues that allows them to be processed in accordance with the proposed strategies.</p>

					Cultural analysts are currently faced with an ecosystem of heterogeneous, globally distributed, and mass-scale sources that cannot be ignored in the research process. In addition to that, cultural analysts need to deal with the emergence of a knowledge economy which is no longer based on the value of the information entities contained in one or more documents, but on the potential for heterogeneous data to be recombined to generate previously unknown knowledge. Therefore, the challenge of accessing a set of heterogeneous, mass-scale, dynamic, and globally distributed sources has been joined to that of transforming the content of these sources into reusable data for the creation of knowledge and value. To the traditional question—What sources should be consulted or selected?—must now be added: What tools should be built and what work procedures should be designed to access those sources on a mass basis and analyze them as data? This article aims to provide some possible answers through the work carried out within the Exhibitium Project. This included the design and implementation of the Expofinder system, which is a technological device meant to examine the mechanisms for dissemination of digital information about art exhibitions and reuse this information as data to generate new knowledge and new interpretations about them. We believe that one of the best ways to strengthen the paths of digital research is to make the methodologies and mechanisms that govern decision-making transparent in order to be discussed or to be adopted by other projects.

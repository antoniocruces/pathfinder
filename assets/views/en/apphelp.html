		<dt>What essential steps should I take to start using  PATHFINDER?</dt>
		<dd>
			They are very few, and quite simple to follow:
			<ol style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
				<li>
					Make sure that you own a name of a valid ID in 
					<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expofinder.uma.es">ExpoFinder</a>. 
					You can get one making contact with de development team.
				</li>
				<li>
					Download the file from the data server and save it in a place known in your computer. 
					Remember that is VERY IMPORTANT to remember the provided PIN: 
					without it you would not decode the JSON file.
				</li>
				<li>
					Open the saved file. PATHFINDER will ask you for the provided PIN.
				</li>
				<li>
					Consult the <a href="javascript:toolkit.goto('documents');">documentation</a> in order to know 
					which are the operations you can make with PATHFINDER and how you can make them.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</dd>
		<dt>Is it necessary an active Internet connection in order to use PATHFINDER?</dt>
		<dd>
			Only to download or renew the JSON file used to prepare the data base, 
			which must have been generated by 
			<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expofinder.uma.es">ExpoFinder</a>.
		</dd>
		<dt>Is it essential to have a very powerful equipment at my disposal in order to work with PATHFINDER?</dt>
		<dd>
			Not at all. In fact, it is not the usual “program” which is necessary to “install” in the client’s computer, 
			but it uses the browser of the computer and it works by scripts. We have tried to keep to the paradigm of 
			Poor Man Computing, praised by Alexander Shchepetkin, I G.P.P UCLA, among others, on his conference in 
			Venice in October 2004. It is about doing the most as possible with the simplest tools and at the 
			reach of anyone. In fact, it is not necessary to acquire additional hard or soft to use it. 
			<br />
			PATHFINDER has been tested in hard conditions, with little RAM available, with diverse operative systems, 
			(Windows, macOS, Linux) and with a broad group of browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari). 
			Visit the <a href="javascript:toolkit.goto('settings');">requirements</a> page to find out. 
			The only indispensable thing is to have an updated 
			version of the browser you will use. PATHFINDER uses exceptional technology 
			(ECMAScript 5, 6 and a few elements of the 7) which leverage the most developed programming characteristics. 
			An obsolete browser will not work well, it will make errors and it will not allow to obtain the proper efficiency. 
		</dd>
		<dt>
			Can I use the data belonging from 
			<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expofinder.uma.es">ExpoFinder</a> 
			for my research and publish them?
		</dt>
		<dd>
			PATHFINDER legal terms stablish so. Its main goal is to be a <em>helping tool</em> for the investigation 
			in the Digital History of Art and Digital Humanities environment. 
			However, you will need to have a permission at your disposal in order to do that, 
			mainly because you will not have access to updated data if you do not own a set of credentials from 
			<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expofinder.uma.es">ExpoFinder</a>. 
			In the <a href="javascript:toolkit.goto('legal');">legal</a> page you can locate the information needed.
		</dd>
		<dt>What can I do if I lose or forget the access PIN to the JSON file? </dt>
		<dd>
			PATHFINDER uses data from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expofinder.uma.es">ExpoFinder</a> 
			in a file encoded by a symmetric algorithm, simple but efficient, before being stored in the disc 
			of the client’s computer. It would not decode it if you do not own that password. 
			In that case, you will need to make a new <a href="javascript:toolkit.goto('data');">download</a>. 
		</dd>
		<dt>What can I do if an error appears while I try to make an operation?</dt>
		<dd>
			In the first place, take note of the message shown on the screen. 
			Usually the information about the error is simple, but it is possible to make it more detailed. 
			For that, go to the <a href="javascript:toolkit.goto('settings');">settings</a> page and 
			in the section Settings &rarr; Errors control &rarr; Detailed error messages mark yes. 
			Once you obtain the “trajectory” of the error, take note and send the copy to 
			the PATHFINDER development team using for that the 
			<a href="javascript:toolkit.goto('legal');">contact page</a>.
		</dd>
		<dt>
			Once I open the download JSON file from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expofinder.uma.es">ExpoFinder</a> 
			it gives me error saying that the registration is not correct. What can have caused this?
		</dt>
		<dd>
			Mainly four things:
			<ol style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">
				<li>
					Sometimes throughout the data download from the server, there is a chance that an unnoticed 
					network error causes an imbalance of some type. In that case, the file will save with that error 
					and it could not be used. You will need to download it again.
				</li>
				<li>
					If an incorrect <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expofinder.uma.es">ExpoFinder</a> 
					credentials set is specified in order to identify yourself in the data server, PATHFINDER 
					“silently fails”, so it will not alert any intruder in and it will simply download a file 
					with incorrect content. If you try to access it and charge it in the database an error is made.
				</li>
				<li>
					The PIN that you specified when you open the file is not correct. Doing that, PATHFINDER 
					obtains a wrong decoding and the values that the system search for are not correct. 
					Try the operation again and make sure that the PIN is the appropriate one. 
				</li>
				<li>
					You have tried to open a file which has not been downloaded in the 
					<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expofinder.uma.es">ExpoFinder</a> server 
					and obviously it does not contain the relevant information. Make the download again. 
				</li>
			</ol>
		</dd>
		<dt>
			Does PATHFINDER take long to charge the database?
		</dt>
		<dd>
			During the charging process the app makes numerous operations, among them “cleaning” 
			the erroneous searches and calculate the age from those searches. In general terms, 
			even these numbers depend on microprocessor of the client’s computer, PATHFINDER processes 
			between 37000 and 45000 searches per second, so 500000 searches are processed in a lapse 
			that oscillates between 11 and 13,5 seconds. Filtering operations, pagination and search are 
			below 1 second for the data volume although it depends on the complexity of the filtering conditions.

		<dd>
			The best way is using a <em>filter</em>. For that, you will need to access to the 
			<a href="javascript:toolkit.goto('legal');">data</a> page, make sure that you have a valid JSON file, 
			charge it in the database and open it in <em>list</em>. The headline of the paged table shows two symbols: 
			<span class="no-data">[+]</span> to add conditions to the filter and 
			<span class="no-data">[-]</span> to remove all the conditions to the filter. 
			If you do the last one PATHFINDER will return to its initial state, in which every search will be 
			considered and the work field is not delimited by the creation of a subset of data or dataset.
			<br /><br />
			Remember that the conditions are logical and they apply making operations of 
			<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)"><em>intersection</em></a>, 
			<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)"><em>union</em></a> or 
			<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)#Relative_complement"><em>difference</em></a>  
			of sets (“datasets”). 
			Consult the specific help section in the filter window to obtain specific instructions of how to make them.
